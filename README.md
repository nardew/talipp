`talipp` (or `tali++`) is a Python library implementing financial indicators for technical analysis. The distinctive feature of the library is its incremental computation which fits extremely well real-time applications or applications with iterative input in general.  

Unlike existing libraries for technical analysis which typically have to work on the whole input vector in order to calculate new values of indicators, `talipp` due to its incremental architecture calculates new indicators' values exclusively based on the delta input data. That implies, among others, it requires `O(1)` time to produce new values in comparison to `O(n)` (or worse) required by other libraries.

Supported incremental operations include:

- appending new values to the input
- updating the last input value
- removing arbitrary number of the input values

Besides the already mentioned superior time complexity for delta input operations, `talipp`'s incremental approach immediately offers other interesting features for free, such as indicator chaining or building new indicators combined from other indicators. See section with examples to get an idea.

Incremental nature of `talipp` naturally excels in applications with frequent `CUD` operations but it can be used for charting, back-testing, ... as any other existing library.

Last but not least, `talipp` is a very young project and therefore open to any suggestions of amending the API to users' liking. You are encouraged to come up with proposals.

### Examples

Consult `examples` folder to see usage of every single indicator included in the library. To get the basic look and feel of the API, see below. 

```python
from talipp.indicators import EMA, SMA, Stoch
from talipp.ohlcv import OHLCVFactory

# EMA indicator ([float] -> [float])
ema = EMA(period = 3, input_values = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

# treat indicators as any other list
print(f'EMA(3): {ema}') # [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 4.5, 4.25, 5.125, 6.5625, 8.28125]
print(f'Last EMA value: {ema[-1]}') # 8.28125

# append a new input value incrementally
ema.add_input_value(11)
print(f'EMA after adding a new value:      {ema}') # [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 4.5, 4.25, 5.125, 6.5625, 8.28125, 9.640625]

# change the last added value
ema.update_input_value(15)
print(f'EMA after updating the last value: {ema}') # [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 4.5, 4.25, 5.125, 6.5625, 8.28125, 11.640625]

# change the last added value again
ema.update_input_value(18)
print(f'EMA after updating the last value: {ema}') # [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 4.5, 4.25, 5.125, 6.5625, 8.28125, 13.140625]

# remove the last added value
ema.remove_input_value()
print(f'EMA after removing the last value: {ema}') # [3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 4.5, 4.25, 5.125, 6.5625, 8.28125]

# purge the oldest input value
ema.purge_oldest(1)
print(f'EMA after purging the oldest value: {ema}') # [5.0, 7.0, 4.5, 4.25, 5.125, 6.5625, 8.28125]

# STOCH indicator ([OHLCV] -> [composite])
stoch = Stoch(5, 3, OHLCVFactory.from_dict({
    'high':     [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35],
    'low':      [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19],
    'close':    [3, 9, 8, 19, 18, 17, 19]
}))

# print result as a list of composite values for 'k' and 'd' output parameters
print(f'Stoch(5, 3) composite result: {stoch}') # [StochVal(k=70.83333333333333, d=None), StochVal(k=50.0, d=None), StochVal(k=42.857142857142854, d=54.563492063492056)]

# print result as lists per output parameters
print(f'Stoch(5, 3) decomposed result: {stoch.to_lists()}') # {'k': [70.83333333333333, 50.0, 42.857142857142854], 'd': [None, None, 54.563492063492056]} 

# Indicator chaining
sma1 = SMA(3)
sma2 = SMA(3, input_indicator = sma1)
sma3 = SMA(3, input_indicator = sma2)

print(f"Chain three moving averages:")
sma1.add_input_value([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
print(f"SMA1: {sma1}") # [2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]
print(f"SMA2: {sma2}") # [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
print(f"SMA3: {sma3}") # [4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0]

print(f"Purge oldest 3 values:")
sma1.purge_oldest(3)
print(f"SMA1: {sma1}") # [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]
print(f"SMA2: {sma2}") # [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
print(f"SMA3: {sma3}") # [7.0]
```

### Performance

To illustrate performance scaling of `talipp` we ran several tests together with the industry standard `talib` library and its python wrapper [ta-lib](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib). The takeaway from the comparison is following:

- for batch processing (i.e. one-off calculation of indicators without addition of further delta values) `talib` is a clear winner. This is not surprising at all since it is implemented in C and it is tailored for vector calculations in one shot. `talipp`'s incremental (i.e. not vector) calculation and features such as indicator chaining (which internally implements output listeners) must inevitably come at a cost. That being said, `talipp` calculates SMA for batch of 50k values incrementally still in ~200ms which is perfectly acceptable for many applications
- where `talipp` clearly takes the lead is  incremental calculation. Again this is well expected since `talipp`'s CUD operations take `O(1)` time compared to `O(n)` time of `talib`. For 50k input the difference is as big as ~200ms vs. ~6800ms.
- from the graphs it is apparent that `talipp` scales linearly with the size of the input compared to quadratic curve of `talib` when incremental operations are concerned. This follows from `talipp`'s `O(1)` time for delta operations vs. `talib`'s `O(n)`.
